          <strong>Maya</strong> is a qualified Reiki Master, Yoga Practitioner,
          Circle Facilitator and Cacao Guardian.
        </p>
        <p>
          “On my path to understand ‘who I am’ I have learnt that I am a
          mult-dimensional being, I am a dreamer, a learner and a teacher!
        </p>
        <p>
          I started my self-development journey to deeply understand my heart,
          body, mind and soul. This road has taken me through a multitude of
          experiences. I’ve studied the human body, the brain and how important
          our emotions and feelings are to our overall well being. In this
          process I have unlayered my heart, mind and body and discovered my
          true-self!
        </p>
        <p>
          Through everything that I’ve been learning I created Maya Guardian
          Healing to serve, guide and help people to find the connection between
          mind, body and soul by unlayering the repetitive patterns and
          connecting with their true selves.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Mixing her Yoga qualifications and experience that she has gained
          through her self development journey, she carefully laces her yoga
          classes with deep self-awareness, connecting the breath, mind, body,
          and soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the class, you will experience a deep connection with your
          body, understand more about yourself, and release and unwind in a fun
          and joyful way.
