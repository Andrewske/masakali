          Shanti in Sanskrit means calmness, peace, tranquillity, quietness,
          rest, stillness. Living Shanti offers you a different mindset in the
          path of mastering the flow of nature – embracing both pleasure and
          pain, your light as well as your dark. It’s having the confidence to
          be unapologetically yourself in every moment; both hot and holy, in
          and out of the bedroom - to be free!.
        </p>
        <p>
          What does it take? A willingness to undergo a next-level upgrade of
          your emotional, energetic, physical and spiritual being. Clearing
          stagnant energies, unresolved situations and past traumas, awakening
          your life force energy, integrating your shadows, igniting your
          self-expression, aligning your life purpose, opening your intuition,
          and entering the world of the magical you!
        </p>
        <p>
          What does this look like? Through transformative Breathwork, Yoga and
          Workshops practices, ceremonies, song, movement and stillness
          sessions, you will come home to the wisdom and power of your body and
          heart – where the confidence to be yourself and embrace your real, raw
          and wild being lives!
        </p>
