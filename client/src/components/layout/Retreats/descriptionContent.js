          Shanti in Sanskrit means calmness, peace, tranquility, quietness,
          rest, and stillness. Living Shanti offers you a different mindset in
          the path of mastering the flow of nature – embracing both pleasure and
          pain, your light as well as your dark. It’s having the confidence to
          be unapologetically yourself in every moment - to be free!

          spiritual being. Clearing stagnant energies, unresolved situations and
          past traumas, awakening your life force energy, integrating your
          shadows, igniting your self-expression, aligning your life purpose,
          opening your intuition, and entering the world of the magic that is
          you!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What does this look like?</strong> Through transformative
          Breathwork, Yoga and other workshops, practices, ceremonies, song,
          movement and stillness sessions, you will come home to the wisdom and
          power of your body and heart – where the confidence to be yourself and
          embrace your real, raw and wild being lives!
        </p>
