The staff at Masakali really makes this place. They take such good care of you and are very helpful. You can order breakfast, lunch or dinner to your room, massages, a flower bath, laundry service and they will help plan out your day and transportation if needed. Just note that if you plan to use grab or gojek, it is a 20 minute drive/scooter ride out of the main part of ubud. Thank you to the entire team at Masakali! Can‚Äôt wait to come back.`,

Outside, there's a great swimming pool and a net to chill and enjoy the stunning view to the rice fields. During our stay, we had all our meals there and the food was always delicious (specially the pasta pesto - our favourite).

If you want to have a very peaceful and marvelous then book this accommodation for more than two nights because one day isn‚Äôt enough.

The bathroom was very nice and clean as well. Since the villa is in the middle of rice paddies there are some insects (as can be expected) but the villa has everything you need from mosquito spray to the in-scents to keep the insects away.
      
      The communictaion with the hist was effortless and everything from check-in to check-out went very smoothly. The staff the resort is amazing: very helpful and friendly. They make sure you have eberything you need. I came with my dog and they even helped me to buy some food for her as well.
      
      Will definitely be coming back soon again and wpuld reccommend staying here for anyone who is looking for a super relaxing and peaceful stay.`,
