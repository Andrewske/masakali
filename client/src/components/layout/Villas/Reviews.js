If you need to treat yourself, rejuvenate, contemplate the world of natural beauty, you simply must stay here for a personal sanctuary stay.

You really live in the jungle and feel it with every breath you take, it is truely amazing and so much fun! It is super clean but dont forget, its in the jungle and the shower is basically outside, so is the living room, as there are open windows that have no glass and therefore cant be shut... and thats why we loved it!',

The outdoor space, the bedroom, and the bathroom were all well-kept and high quality, and the friendly staff were accommodating of any requests. The villa is more remote, which was exactly what we were looking for with this stay. As a result, restaurants and convenience stores were not walkable, but the villa offered a driver as well as motorbikes or bicycles. We mostly ate the food prepared by the hotel, and it was great and a good price! If I ever make it back to Ubud, I will definitely stay here again, and I recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing, nature-oriented stay in Bali.',

Outside, there's a great swimming pool and a net to chill and enjoy the stunning view to the rice fields.

      The room was very clean and everything was exactly as in the pictures. If you prefer to cool yourself it‚Äôs possible in a small kitchen in the front which includes everything you need. The bathroom was very nice and clean as well. Since the villa is in the middle of rice paddies there are some insects (as can be expected) but the villa has everything you need from mosquito spray to the in-scents to keep the insects away.
      
      The communictaion with the hist was effortless and everything from check-in to check-out went very smoothly. The staff the resort is amazing: very helpful and friendly. They make sure you have eberything you need. I came with my dog and they even helped me to buy some food for her as well.
      
      Will definitely be coming back soon again and wpuld reccommend staying here for anyone who is looking for a super relaxing and peaceful stay.`,

This place just deserves to be known by everyone and you're truely missing out if you didn't stay here!!! The location is a little bit out of Ubud, but you can go anywhere with the scooter.
