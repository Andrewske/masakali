      The real standout was the customer service from Ira and all of the staff. They were on hand at any moment to ensure that we had everything we needed. My partner had arranged some special birthday surprises for me, which he had been arranging prior to us even arriving in Bali. It really felt like they had genuine passion to make every moment unforgettable and we felt like we were the only guests even though we were not.
      
      I would highly recommend this accommodation to anyone who is looking for a one of a kind experience when staying in Ubud.`,

Not only is the villa comfortable, gorgeous, and exactly as the listing showed, but it was secluded enough to feel like you're in the wilderness, which was exactly what I was looking for. Swimming at night, I got to see lightning bugs on the rice terraces, it was incredible. I felt so safe here. The best part of my stay was the staff - everyone was so amazing! Ira and I communicated via text, and she was super quick to respond - the meals were all perfect, the wine was divine, I wish I could have stayed longer. I will, without a doubt, be back for another stay.`,

The staff is so nice and available, they did everything they could to make us have the time of our lives. I would 1000% recommend this place.`,

The place overall was very nice and romantic getaway for couples. Thank you to all the staff for being so warm and welcoming. Staff hospitality was top notch!`,
