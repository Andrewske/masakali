Notes Round 2

VISION:
//Can remove -Masakali- I think on vision page and just start with definition.

//Was trying to do definition of Masakali in larger italicized or different font and also with two border lines on top and bottom like in the attached vision page if possible but only if it still looks good on phone app of course.  Sorry because I don’t think I was very clear in my email re: what I was trying to do there.  
//Is it possible to fix the written content at Vision so the word “liberating” isn’t a lone word by itself. Is it possible to put text in full justification or something to ensure that doesn’t happen anywhere on any page?
//And on the mobile friendly app, in the vision section, the written content didn’t show up for some reason
 

THE LAND

//You can remove the word Location. Lexi will probably want to change the color of the Kelusa, Payangan, Bali from blue to our purple color but other than that it looks great
 

FACILITIES

//You can remove the second “Facilities”.  Leave the one in the header of course but don’t need it twice as it would be redundant but otherwise thumbs up (although I realized the architect didn’t make the changes I requested to location of lumbungs or spelling of café like I asked so I’m hoping we will get updated one soon)
 

GALLERY

//Looks good – Lexi will let us know what photos to put there.  I think for the home page we should just put the best ones we have of some of the views, the Surya Guesthouse, pool, landscaping, water fountains, etc. and remove the labels on the photos that identify what you are looking at since you will make an actual link to a separate gallery page with “Complete” and “Under Construction” links and include “Surya”, “Chandra”, “Jala”, “Yoga Shala” and “Luxury Villa”.  Will definitely get Lexi’s feedback on photo content as she is the best at this stuff as you can see from her power point presentation from last year.
 

//ADD VIDEO

 

EXPERIENCE:

//See attached updated content
 

COMMUNITY

//Community needs the gray background or whatever color comes next after we insert/upload video under gallery. Adding that video page will throw stuff off your flipping between white and gray colors of course. But love the flipping between gray and white background.  Really works well.
//Attached is updated content.
//On mobile friendly app (which is almost perfect by the way), the photo of the kids isn’t fitting properly.
 

AMENITIES PERFECT

//I love it so much the way you did this and look forward to seeing the separate pages you create from Lexi’s powerpoint.
